# hw1-semantic-tags

This lesson and the corresponding webpage are used for practicing semantic tags. Using a variety of HTML tags such as header, footer, nav, etc. the HTML file is now more readable and accessible from user and future developer perspectives. The CSS file has been updated properly to maintain the application's original aesthetic. The final result was developed using principles from GitHub, Terminal, HTML, and CSS.
